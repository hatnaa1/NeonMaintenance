# Maintenance Page Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React, TypeScript, Express, and Drizzle ORM. The application displays a minimalist cyberpunk-themed maintenance page with futuristic visual effects, animations, and multiple theme variants. It features a clean design with a countdown timer, animated particles flowing from top to bottom, and a comprehensive theme system featuring 4 distinct cyberpunk color palettes.

The tech stack includes:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build tool, TailwindCSS for styling
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (using Neon serverless driver)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Build System**: The application uses Vite as the build tool and development server. The frontend code lives in the `client/` directory with a clear separation between source code (`client/src/`) and the HTML entry point (`client/index.html`).

**Routing Strategy**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing. Currently configured to show the maintenance page for all routes, indicating the application is in a pre-launch or maintenance state.

**Component System**: Implements shadcn/ui's "New York" style variant, which provides a comprehensive set of pre-built accessible components based on Radix UI primitives. Components are organized in `client/src/components/ui/` and use class-variance-authority for variant management.

**Styling Approach**: TailwindCSS with a custom cyberpunk-inspired dark theme. The design system features:
- Dark navy/black base colors
- Neon accent colors (electric blue, magenta, purple)
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- Responsive design with mobile-first breakpoints

**Design Philosophy**: The maintenance page follows a "Cyberpunk-Inspired Minimalism" approach with animated particles, geometric shapes, and neon gradient effects, as documented in `design_guidelines.md`.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript, configured for both development and production environments. The server handles API routes and serves the built frontend in production.

**Development Workflow**: Uses tsx for running TypeScript directly in development mode. The server integrates with Vite's middleware in development for hot module replacement.

**API Structure**: All application routes are prefixed with `/api`. The routes are registered through a central `registerRoutes` function in `server/routes.ts`.

**Request Logging**: Custom middleware logs API requests with timing information, response status, and truncated response bodies for debugging.

**Static File Serving**: In production, the server serves the built React application from the `dist/public` directory.

### Data Storage Solutions

**ORM Choice**: Drizzle ORM was chosen for type-safe database operations with PostgreSQL. The schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts` for sharing between frontend and backend.

**Database Provider**: Uses Neon's serverless PostgreSQL driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`) for serverless-compatible database connections.

**Schema Design**: Currently implements a basic user table with:
- UUID primary keys (generated by PostgreSQL)
- Username and password fields
- Unique constraint on usernames

**Data Validation**: Uses Zod schemas (via drizzle-zod) for runtime validation of insert operations, ensuring type safety at both compile time and runtime.

**Dual Storage Pattern**: Implements an `IStorage` interface with a temporary in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`) for development/testing. This allows easy swapping to database-backed storage without changing application code.

**Migration Strategy**: Uses Drizzle Kit for schema migrations, with migrations output to the `migrations/` directory. Database schema changes are pushed using the `db:push` script.

### Authentication and Authorization

**Current State**: Basic user schema exists but no authentication middleware is implemented yet. The schema supports username/password authentication with unique usernames.

**Prepared Infrastructure**: The presence of session-related packages (`connect-pg-simple` for PostgreSQL session store) suggests the architecture is prepared for cookie-based session authentication.

**Password Handling**: Currently stores passwords as plain text in the schema - this would need to be addressed with proper hashing (bcrypt/argon2) before production use.

### External Dependencies

**UI Component Libraries**:
- Radix UI: Provides unstyled, accessible component primitives for dialogs, dropdowns, tooltips, and more
- shadcn/ui: Pre-styled component system built on Radix UI
- Lucide React: Icon library for consistent iconography
- class-variance-authority: Type-safe variant system for components

**State & Data Fetching**:
- TanStack React Query: Handles server state management, caching, and data synchronization
- React Hook Form: Form state management with validation
- Zod: Schema validation for both forms and database operations

**Database & Backend**:
- Neon Serverless: PostgreSQL driver optimized for serverless/edge environments
- Drizzle ORM: TypeScript ORM for type-safe database operations
- connect-pg-simple: PostgreSQL-backed session store for Express

**Development Tools**:
- Replit-specific plugins: Vite plugins for error overlays, cartographer, and dev banners when running on Replit
- ESBuild: Bundles the server code for production deployment

**Styling & Animation**:
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework
- PostCSS with Autoprefixer: CSS processing pipeline
- Embla Carousel: Carousel/slider component
- date-fns: Date manipulation and formatting

**Routing**: Wouter is used instead of React Router for a smaller bundle size while maintaining similar functionality.
